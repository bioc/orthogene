Description: 
    orthogene is an R package for easy mapping of orthologous genes across hundreds of species. 
    It pulls up-to-date interspecies gene ortholog mappings across 700+ organisms.
    It also provides various utility functions to map common objects 
    (e.g. data.frames, gene expression matrices, lists) 
    onto 1:1 gene orthologs from any other species.
